## General Headers
| **Header** | **Example** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Date` | `Date: Wed, 16 Feb 2022 10:38:44 GMT` | Holds the date and time at which the message originated. It's preferred to convert the time to the standard [UTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time) time zone. |
| `Connection` | `Connection: close` | Dictates if the current network connection should stay alive after the request finishes. Two commonly used values for this header are `close` and `keep-alive`. The `close` value from either the client or server means that they would like to terminate the connection, while the `keep-alive` header indicates that the connection should remain open to receive more data and input. |

## Entity Headers
| **Header** | **Example** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Content-Type` | `Content-Type: text/html` | Used to describe the type of resource being transferred. The value is automatically added by the browsers on the client-side and returned in the server response. The `charset` field denotes the encoding standard, such as [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8). |
| `Media-Type` | `Media-Type: application/pdf` | The `media-type` is similar to `Content-Type`, and describes the data being transferred. This header can play a crucial role in making the server interpret our input. The `charset` field may also be used with this header. |
| `Boundary` | `boundary=delimiter` | Acts as a marker to separate content when there is more than one in the same message. For example, within a form data request, this boundary gets used as `--delimiter` to separate different parts of the form. |
| `Content-Length` | `Content-Length: 385` | Holds the size of the entity being passed. This is necessary as the server uses it to read data from the message body, and is generated by the browser and tools like `cURL`. |
| `Content-Encoding` | `Content-Encoding: gzip` | Data can undergo multiple transformations before being passed. For example, it may be encoded to reduce its size. The type of encoding being used should be specified using the `Content-Encoding` header. |

⚠️ Review: `Media-Type` verify intended usage.

## Request Headers
| **Header** | **Example** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Host` | `Host: www.inlanefreight.com` | Used to specify the host being queried for the resource. This can be a domain name or an IP address. HTTP servers can be configured to host different websites, which are revealed based on the hostname. This makes the host header an important enumeration target, as it can indicate the existence of other hosts on the target server. |
| `User-Agent` | `User-Agent: curl/7.77.0` | The `User-Agent` header is used to describe the client requesting resources. This header can reveal a lot about the client, such as the browser, its version, and the operating system. |
| `Referer` | `Referer: http://www.inlanefreight.com/` | Denotes where the current request is coming from. For example, clicking a link from Google search results would make `https://google.com` the referer. Trusting this header can be dangerous as it can be easily manipulated, leading to unintended consequences. |
| `Accept` | `Accept: */*` | Describes which media types the client can understand. It can contain multiple media types separated by commas. The `*/*` value signifies all media types. |
| `Cookie` | `Cookie: PHPSESSID=b4e4fbd29b8d7b...` | Contains cookie-value pairs in the format `name=value`. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the client-side and sent to the server with each request. Cookies can have various uses, such as maintaining session state, storing preferences, and tracking users. |
| `Authorization` | `Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=` | Another method for the server to identify clients. After successful authentication, the server returns a token unique to the client. Unlike cookies, tokens are stored on the client-side and sent with each request. There are multiple types of authentication, such as `Basic`, `Bearer`, and `Digest`. |

## Response Headers
| **Header** | **Example** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Server` | `Server: Apache/2.2.14 (Win32)` | Contains information about the HTTP server, which can be used to identify it. |
| `Set-Cookie` | `Set-Cookie: PHPSESSID=b4e4fbd29b8d7b...` | Contains the cookies needed for client identification. Browsers parse the cookies and store them for future requests. This header follows the same format as the `Cookie` request header. |
| `WWW-Authenticate` | `WWW-Authenticate: BASIC realm="localhost"` | Notifies the client about the type of authentication required to access the requested resource. |

## Security Headers
| **Header** | **Example** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Content-Security-Policy` | `Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self'` | Dictates the website's policy towards injected scripts. This can help prevent XSS attacks by restricting the sources from which scripts can be loaded. |
| `Strict-Transport-Security` | `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000` | Prevents the browser from accessing the website over the plaintext HTTP protocol, and forces all communication to be carried over the secure HTTPS protocol. This prevents attackers from sniffing web traffic and accessing protected information such as passwords or other sensitive data. |
| `Referrer-Policy` | `Referrer-Policy: origin` | Dictates whether the browser should include the value specified via the `Referer` header or not. It can help in avoiding disclosing sensitive URLs and information while browsing the website. |

## Cookie attributes (server-side via Set-Cookie)
| Attribute | Outcome |
| --- | --- |
| `HttpOnly` | JavaScript cannot read the cookie (mitigates cookie theft via XSS, not all impacts). |
| `Secure` | Cookie only sent over HTTPS. |
| `SameSite` | Limits cross-site cookie sending (CSRF mitigation). Values: `Strict`, `Lax`, `None`. |

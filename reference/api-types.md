| API type | Typical transport | Typical format | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| REST | HTTP | JSON (often) | Resource-oriented; uses standard HTTP verbs. |
| GraphQL | HTTP | JSON | Client specifies requested fields; single endpoint commonly. |
| SOAP | HTTP | XML | Strongly structured envelopes; heavier legacy/enterprise usage. |
| RPC (JSON-RPC / XML-RPC) | HTTP | JSON/XML | Procedure/method oriented; request specifies method + params. |
